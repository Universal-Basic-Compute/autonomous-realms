# Autonomous Realms

An AI-powered isometric settlement simulation game where you lead a tribe from prehistoric beginnings through the development of civilization.

## Overview

Autonomous Realms is a unique city-building game that leverages AI technology in two revolutionary ways:
1. All visual assets are dynamically generated based on gameplay context
2. AI entities are powered by KinOS to create truly autonomous cities with emergent behavior

Unlike traditional city builders where buildings and characters are pre-designed and AI follows scripted behavior, Autonomous Realms creates a living, evolving world where each city has its own personality, diplomatic relations, and visual identity.

## Features

- **Dynamic World Generation**: Explore procedurally generated terrain with AI-created visuals
- **Language Development**: Guide your tribe's language evolution from basic gestures to complex communication
- **Cultural Evolution**: Shape your tribe's beliefs, social structures, and traditions
- **Resource Management**: Gather, craft, and manage resources to help your settlement thrive
- **Technology Research**: Discover and develop new technologies to advance your civilization
- **Settlement Building**: Establish and expand your settlement with buildings and infrastructure
- **Character Development**: Create and nurture unique individuals within your tribe
