---

## Project Overview

**Autonomous Realms** is a groundbreaking city-building game that leverages AI technology in two revolutionary ways:
1. All visual assets are dynamically generated by **Ideogram AI** based on gameplay context
2. AI entities are powered by **KinOS** to create truly autonomous cities with emergent behavior

Unlike traditional city builders where buildings and characters are pre-designed and AI follows scripted behavior, Autonomous Realms creates a living, evolving world where each city has its own personality, diplomatic relations, and visual identity.

## Core Innovations

### Dynamic Asset Generation (Ideogram)
- Buildings, characters, landscapes and UI elements generated on-demand
- Visual styles evolve based on cultural development and city prosperity
- Each player's world looks visually unique while maintaining a coherent aesthetic
- Assets adapt to gameplay conditions (seasons, events, cultural influences)

### Autonomous AI Simulation (KinOS)
- Cities operate as independent entities with distinct personalities and goals
- Diplomatic relations emerge naturally from AI interactions and decisions
- Complex economic and social systems evolve through AI decision-making
- Unexpected events and stories emerge from AI interactions

---

## Gameplay Experience

### Player Roles
Players can choose from multiple roles with different gameplay experiences:
1. **City Ruler**: Direct control of a single city in competition/cooperation with AI cities
2. **Diplomatic Advisor**: Guide relations between cities without direct control
3. **Shadow Influencer**: Manipulate events from behind the scenes through intrigue
4. **Observer**: Watch the fully autonomous simulation unfold without intervention

### Core Gameplay Loops

#### City Building
- Design and expand your city with dynamically generated buildings
- Balance resources, population needs, and economic development
- Manage cultural evolution and technological advancement
- Respond to environmental challenges and opportunities

#### Diplomacy
- Form alliances, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges
- Navigate complex political landscapes with autonomous AI cities
- Engage in negotiations with cities that have distinct personalities
- Manage diplomatic crises and conflicts

#### Intrigue

## Ideogram Integration

### Asset Generation Pipeline
1. **Context Analysis**: Game state determines what assets need generation
2. **Prompt Construction**: System builds Ideogram prompts with style parameters
3. **Asset Generation**: Ideogram creates the visual asset
4. **Processing**: Asset is cropped, positioned, and integrated into the game
5. **Caching**: Assets are stored for reuse to optimize performance

### Prompt Engineering Framework
- Style guide prompts ensure visual consistency
- Cultural parameters influence architectural styles
- Prosperity levels affect building appearance
- Technology levels determine building complexity
- Environmental factors influence material appearances

### Optimization Strategy
- Background generation of common assets
- Intelligent caching based on likely needs
- Progressive loading of assets
- Placeholder system during generation
- Fallback to generic assets when needed
